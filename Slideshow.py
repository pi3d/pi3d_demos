"""This demo shows the use of the Orthographic Camerae for 2D drawing. Also
threading is used to allow the file access to be done in the background.

Schuitz screwed around with this a lot to handle an arbitrary number of
textures (within reasonable limits) fading in and out on top of each
other without breaking the UI.  I settled on 8.

The method is a little involved.  There are a small number of Canvases (8)
that get recycled.  A "Carousel" class keeps track of which canvas has focus and
what texture file index (from the file list) it contains.  Handy % operators keep the
'carousel' and texture file indices wrapping around properly at the ends.

The init condition has the 0th file somewhere in the middle, with focus,
to pre-buffer some images in either direction.

Conceptually, when the slides are navigated left or right, a canvas slot falls off the
far end and tacked on the approaching end, where a thread fills in a texture from
the file list in the same direction.

Confused yet?

Everything gets straighted out with the Carousel.draw() function which knows to
draw out the canvases far to near (thanks to opengl transparency gotchas), so it
will know which to start drawing first from the currently focused canvas.  At least the
canvasses are always in a spatial sequential order, except for the wraparound.

An update() function checks the fade directions and visibility of each canvas and
adjusts the alphas every time it is called.  Other transforms could happen in here later.

In a future version I want to employ a lock to hold threads from starting until a
screen draw activity flag has gone quiet, or some timeout happens.

There is still some interesting behaviour when the UI overruns the thread progress.
You see the previously loaded texture until the thread catches up.  See for example
'falling down barn' and, 8 slides later, 'pi3d splash screen'.  Now go back 8.
